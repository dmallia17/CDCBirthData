This notebook contains my review and refinement of the [CDC Birth Data](
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/Vitalstatsonline.htm), beginning with the
2013 year data, down to datasets which can permit helpful supervised and
unsupervised learning. Packages that enable R to interact with databases and
R Notebook allowing us to use multiple languages side-by-side means that we 
should be able to present most, if not all, of the work involved in this 
one notebook.
